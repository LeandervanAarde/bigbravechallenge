<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->

## Features and Functionality

### Validation
Forms have validation built into them to ensure forms are filled in and users are of age to use the application!

### Personalised character
Characters are built based off of your input! 

### It's all about context!
Context API built into the application for global state management, thus allowing data to parsed easier throughout the application. 

## Dependancies 
### React Color picker
For the project I was required to use atleast one dependancy, users are able to select their favorite color without having to type it or know the exact hex code of it, thus having a better experience due to the React color dependancy! 

### MUI Date picker
In order to ease the development process within a limited timeframe, MUI date picker was used in order to capture birthdays. This was used instead of building an entire calendar from scratch and making my MVP achievable. 

##Time to completion
This project took 7hours and 32 minutes to complete
